Took a second pass on my current prototype, Don\'t Look Back. Crash landed colony ship, Coop/Deduction/Survival Not playable yet but have a basic loop in mind:

Day Phase 

* play card to location 
* move worker from this location to location matching colors of current and previous card played. 

- spend 1 AP per distance 
 -  option -1AP place or adjust defenses at areas passed 
 -  option free pickup and drop off at locations passed 
- activate location at strength level of remaining AP w/ bonus for additional workers on action space 
- play passes clockwise, repeat until all action cards played 
Night Phase
 - shuffle action card stacks 
- reveal and lay out top 3 cards of each stack by rank
 - alien scout effects are resolved - laser and mortar defenses are activated 
- alien wave effects are resolved 
- alien reserve effects are resolved 

**Minimal missing elements** 

- alien row patterns 
- alien effects at varying power levels 
- repair mechanic -
- location actions damaged and undamaged
